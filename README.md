#elm-navigation-example

to start the app run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This example uses pathname parsing instead of hash parsing because I really don't like having hashes in my URLs.

If it doesn't work properly for any reason, let me know and feel free to make a pull request for any improvements you can think of, preferably in the direction of simplicity.

Thanks to [@klemola](https://github.com/klemola) for the bulk of this example. It's mostly all his but split up into smaller modules and using the pathname parsing instead of hash parsing.
